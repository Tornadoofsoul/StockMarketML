Starting on May 2017, Yahoo financial has terminated its service on
the well used EOD data download without warning. This is confirmed
by Yahoo employee in forum posts.

Yahoo financial EOD data, however, still works on Yahoo financial pages.
These download links uses a "crumb" for authentication with a cookie "B".
This code is provided to obtain such matching cookie and crumb.
